## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    An IP address acts as a label or sorts for a device that serves two primary purposes--hosting or network interfaceing identification and location addressing.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    It is a naming system that associates information with domain names assigned the devices. Domain names are much more simple for people to remember and recall as opposed to a much more complex IP addresses. 


3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP addresses never change while dynamic IP addresses are assigned by the network and can change over time. 

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    One establishes a connection before sending and receiving while one does not. 

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    It makes the functions blocking which wastes time. 

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    It means that nothing else can run while it is running-- wasting time that could be spent elsewhere.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Allows us to be more efficient with time. for Non-Blocking code.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

    Interface is the public methods of a class that control how the class behaves. Implementation is how the class actually behaves. this is important for knowing how things will operate in theory compared to in reality
